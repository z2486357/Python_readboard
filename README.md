# readboard

This is a python file which include the packaging to exe file. I don't know why packaging to exe file make system determine it to html file.

This is an application for the initialization of motion tracking system.

You have to initialize the place before you start using motion tracking system. You put a board like the picture "origin.png" on the floor.

The purpose of the application is to find the pixel situation of the middle of the 100 white dot in the picture. And then use the position to find the value in txt file.

First replce all backgroud to black without the application to reduce the error. Like picture "test.png"
